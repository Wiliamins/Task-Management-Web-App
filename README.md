# Task-Management-Web-App
A full-stack serverless web application that allows users to manage tasks — add, edit, delete, and mark them as completed.

Built with React on the frontend and AWS services on the backend, the app uses a scalable and cost-efficient architecture that requires no server maintenance.

Technologies: React, AWS Amplify, AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB, Git 

• Built the user interface using React and Material-UI, allowing users to 
manage tasks with features like adding, editing, deleting and marking tasks 
as completed. 
• Connected the frontend to a backend API to dynamically reflect changes 
and improve user experience. 
• Configured AWS Amplify to host the frontend and set up automated CI/CD 
pipelines triggered by Git repository updates. 
• Developed serverless backend functions with AWS Lambda to handle 
HTTP requests (POST, PUT, DELETE) via API Gateway. 
• Designed the task data model and implemented storage and retrieval logic 
using AWS DynamoDB. 
• Used Git for version control and streamlined the development process.
